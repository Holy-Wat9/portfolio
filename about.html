      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>I was born on August 3rd, 1997 at Mother of Christ Hospital, Ogbete Enugu.(you can go and verify).
        <br>
        I come from a close family of six including my parents, i have three elder siblings(a boy and two girls)and i am the last child of my family. I am a Christian of Roman Catholic denomination. I am from Imo State.
        <br>
        I went to St Mary's Nursery and Primary School,Emene in Enugu State. When i was in Primary 3, there was this event that i can't forget beacause it taught me a lesson at that early age of my life. There was a school feeding program that happened in all schools in Enugu, they came to my school and shared food and drinks(it was a Dano fruit juice). I didn't get that drink but when i was coming back from school that day i told myself not be sad about it, that i will get to drink that fruit juice some other day. Five days later(i counted it), my Mom bought that same drink and gave me, funny thing is that i didn't tell her about that incident. That event taught me how to be patience and be hopeful no matter. I was the best graduating student in my primary school graduation and i was given an English Oxford Dictionary as a gift.
        <br>
        I went to Konigin Des Friedens College  Enugu, Enugu State(KFC Enugu for short) for my Junior secondary education and i went to Federal Government Girls' College Lejja Nsukka,Enugu State for my senior secondary education.
        <br>
        I am a graduate with a degree in Human Nutrition and Dietetics from Michael Okpara University of Agriculture Umudike, Umuahia ,Abia State.
        <br>
        My favorite activities in school was sports, i love football and volleyball. I started playing football at 5,my elder brother had a football and he allowed me to play with him. i learned how to play volleyball in my senior secondary school. I love reading books(articles, newspapers, magazines, novels kind of books) and i am also a fast reader. I enjoin listening to music, sometimes i listen to music while reading, it helps me relax.I love video games(especially football and mission games).
